### Interests

I am broadly interested in the areas of Theoretical Computer Science, Stochastic Systems, Algorithms and Optimization. 

In particular I have studied and worked on problems related to Markov Chains, MDPs and Probabilistic Verification during my 2nd year at IIT Bombay. During my third year I have worked on Weak Memory Models that define the semantics for memory accesses in multi-threaded programs. I also have an interest in studying algorithms for stochastic optimization.
