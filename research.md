### Ongoing

> <strong>Parametrized Verification of Concurrent Programs</strong><br><i>With Prof. [Krishna S.](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~krishnas/), Prof. [Parosh Abdulla](http://user.it.uu.se/~parosh/) and Prof. [Faouzi Atig](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/mohat117/atig)</i><br><br>
>Working on developing efficient verification techniques for concurrent programs in the paramterized setting (where the number of processes is arbitrary).

<br>

> <strong> Problems on Linear Dynamical Systems</strong> [[Phase-1 report](https://ag1502.github.io/docs/btp_report.pdf)]. 
<br> <i>Bachelor's Thesis under the guidance of Prof. [S. Akshay](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~akshayss/)</i><br><br>
Systems modelled by Markov Decision Processes (MDPs) often have a hard-(safety)-constraint that needs to be ensured. This constraint may be specified as a containment property for the state probability distribution vector in some [polytope](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polytope) (a closed convex space bounded by hyperplanes).
The escape problem for Markov Decision Processes (MDPs), asks whether there is an adversarial strategy that takes the state probability vector outside the polytope. We study this problem with the goal of finding a decision procedure. 

<br>

><strong> Graph Database Queries</strong><br>
<i>Research Project under the guidance of Prof. [Krishna S.](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/~krishnas/), Prof. [Wim Martens](https://www.theoinf.uni-bayreuth.de/en/team/martens_wim/index.php), and Prof. [Diego Figueira](https://www.labri.fr/perso/dfigueir/)</i><br><br>
Graph database queries are structural patterns that capture constraints on graph databases and return tuples of satisfying nodes as the answer. We study the boundedness and containment problems in order to characterize complexity and provide algorithms for classes of queries.

### Past Projects

><strong>Verification of programs under Weak Memory Models (WMMs)</strong> <br> Internship in Summer, 2019 at Uppsala University under the guidance of Prof. [Parosh Abdulla](http://user.it.uu.se/~parosh/) and Prof. [Faouzi Atig](http://www.it.uu.se/katalog/mohat117/atig) <br><br>
WMMs define the semantics for memory accesses in multi-threaded programs. There I worked on theoretical proofs and also developed a model checker for verifying programs. This work is under submission.

<br>

><strong>Controlling Parallel Asynchronous Agents</strong><br>Internship in Summer, 2018 at INRIA, Rennes under the guidance of Prof. [Blaise Genest](https://perso.crans.org/genest/) and Prof. [Nathalie Bertrand](http://people.rennes.inria.fr/Nathalie.Bertrand/)<br><br>
 We studied a control problem for parallel asynchronous agents which act independently but are controlled uniformly (same action applied to all agents). I worked on bounding the step complexity (number of steps required for synchronization). A paper with these results is a part of LMCS, Volume 15, Issue 3. [Here](https://ag1502.github.io/popcon.html) are some slides for an overview of the work.
