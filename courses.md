><strong>Top-<i>k</i> arm selection</strong> 
<br>Advanced Concentration Inequalities course<br><br>
We studied variants of the Top-k arm selection problem in the multi-armed bandit setting with Bernoulli bandits. We suggested an alternative stopping criterion and proved better bounds on sample complexity in the
PAC framework. These theoretical results were verified by experiments on a suite of bandit instances. 



I have a fondness for Algorithms and Logic.
