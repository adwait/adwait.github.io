I am a fourth-year undergraduate student at the [Indian Institute of Technology, Bombay](http://www.iitb.ac.in/) in the [Department of Computer Science](https://www.cse.iitb.ac.in/). 

My main interests lie in Programming Languages, Verification and Formal Methods. Please see [Research](https://ag1502.github.io/research) to know more! Also see [Courses](https://ag1502.github.io/courses) for an overview of courses and course projects.
I am also interested in Algorithms and Probabilistic Systems.

I visited Uppsala University in Summer 2019 and was fortunate to be advised by Prof. Parosh Abdulla and Prof. Faouzi Atig. In Summer 2018, I interned at INRIA, Rennes under the guidance of Prof. Blaise Genest and Prof. Nathalie Bertrand.
